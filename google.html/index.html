                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <div class="story-content">
                    <p>Founded in 1985, our school began with a simple mission: to provide quality education that
                        nurtures each child's potential. What started as a small, local initiative has grown into a
                        vibrant community, built on a foundation of dedicated educators and engaged parents. Our history
                        is a testament to our enduring commitment to academic excellence and holistic development.</p>
                    <p>Through the years, we have adapted our curriculum to meet the evolving needs of our students,
                        embracing technology and innovative teaching methods. Yet, our core values remain the same. We
                        celebrate our past achievements while constantly looking toward a future of continued growth and
                        inspiration.</p>
                        <p>As a cornerstone of the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC), our Junior Secondary School (Grades 7, 8, and 9) is designed
                        to be a bridge between primary education and specialized career pathways. It is a period of vital exploration where
                        learners are exposed to a broad and dynamic curriculum that builds a strong foundation in core subjects while allowing
                        for the discovery of individual passions. Through project-based learning, hands-on activities, and a wide array of
                        elective subjects, we guide students in harnessing their talents and interests. This ensures they are not only
                        well-prepared for Senior Secondary School but are also on a confident path toward their future careers</p>
                        <p>Our Junior Secondary program embraces an innovative, forward-thinking approach that prepares young minds for a rapidly
                        changing world. We integrate a wide range of learning areas, from integrated science and pre-technical studies to
                        computer science and foreign languages, providing students with the knowledge and skills for the future. By focusing on
                        critical thinking, problem-solving, and digital literacy, we empower our students to become confident, adaptable, and
                        lifelong learners. This dynamic and engaging learning journey is designed to equip them with the resilience and
                        intellectual curiosity to succeed both in the next level of education and in life</p>
                        <P>At Harambee Comprehensive School, we are committed to the holistic growth of every learner, nurturing their academic,
                        social, emotional, and physical development. Our approach is centered on the whole child, focusing on character
                        development and life skills as much as academic rigor. In this supportive environment, students are encouraged to become
                        independent thinkers, responsible global citizens, and empathetic leaders. Beyond the classroom, our comprehensive
                        program includes a range of extracurricular activities and mentorship opportunities, providing a nurturing space for
                        young teenagers to mature in faith, character, and confidence</P>
